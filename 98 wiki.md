STM32 takes years to learn and if you can master it you will find a decent job.

Even though it is not as hard as FPGA (aka FGPA, you win manji), the learning curve is still steep for STM32. [Read this article about people discuss about STM32.](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-start-learning-STM32-Is-it-worth-it) Most part of the job ES team doing is trying to understand what other's code doing, and trying to mod and create our own code. (Which is faster and easier)

There're basically two part of coding when it comes to STM32. If you start the project from zero, you needs to create the driver for all device you using from defining GPIOs to understand and use the communicate protocols, and after all device around your STM32 is created, you add logic to them so they are running and interacting with each others.

A good way to learn is read through the code. All previous code we use is available in the code section of this repository.
